# Emissions-and-Temp-Analysis
Data analysis to see the correlation between emissions and temperature. Python was used to extract the total emissions from emissions.csv and temperature changes from temperatureChanges.csv and combine it together in emissiontemps.csv to make analysis easier. Then R was used to find the correlation using pearsons algorithm and to graph the data.
